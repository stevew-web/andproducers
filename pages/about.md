## About AndProducers

AndProducers is a free, practical resource for modern marketing production — built around templates, playbooks, and “how it really works” guides.

### Why it exists
Most teams don’t need *more* tools. They need:
- clearer briefs,
- tighter handoffs,
- cleaner versioning,
- and predictable QA.

### Editorial stance
- Operator‑led (not theory).
- Minimal process that scales.
- AI used where it helps — governed where it can harm.

### Contact / collaboration
If you want to suggest a topic, sponsor a template, or collaborate on a playbook, add your preferred email here.
