# The Ultimate Creative Brief Template (plus examples that don’t suck)

A good brief is not “more detail”. It’s **the right detail** - the stuff that prevents rework.

### Copy/paste brief (core)
**1) Goal (one sentence):**  
What change are we trying to create?

**2) Audience:**  
Who is it for? What do they already believe?

**3) Offer / message hierarchy:**  
Primary message → secondary message → proof.

**4) Deliverables:**  
Channel, formats, sizes, counts, languages, deadlines.

**5) Specs & constraints:**  
File weight, character limits, safe zones, required logo/CTA/legal.

**6) Brand / examples:**  
2–3 references of “this is close”.

**7) Measurement:**  
How will we judge success (and where will we see it)?

**8) Approvals:**  
Who approves, by when, and what happens if they miss the deadline?

### What to add for each channel
- **Paid social:** hook in first 2 seconds, aspect ratios, subtitles rules.
- **Display:** size list, click behaviour, animation limits, fallback rules.
- **CRM:** subject line guidance, dynamic fields, personalisation rules.

### Mini example (display)
- Goal: drive plan upgrades for existing customers
- Audience: “out-of-contract” mobile customers
- Deliverables: 6 sizes, static + HTML5, 3 key messages, 2 CTAs
- Constraints: max 150kb HTML5, legal line must always show
