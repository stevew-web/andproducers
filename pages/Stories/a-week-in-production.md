# A week in production: what really slows delivery (and how teams fix it)

Every “late” campaign usually has the same root causes — just with different costumes.

### The usual blockers
1. **The brief wasn’t final**
   - Specs changed mid-build
   - Messaging changed after design started

2. **Feedback came from everywhere**
   - Multiple stakeholders commenting in different places
   - No single approval owner

3. **QA happened too late**
   - Truncation, legals, click behaviour found at the end
   - Result: rebuild under time pressure

### The fixes that actually work
- **One source of truth:** a single brief + matrix link, always updated
- **One approval owner:** feedback is consolidated before it hits production
- **QA early:** quick spec + fit checks before polished build
- **Two rounds max:** if you need more, you need a re-brief

### What to do next
Start with the brief template: **/templates/creative-brief-template/**  
Then tighten approvals: **/guides/approval-workflows/**
