## How to price creative production: retainers, capacity, and SLAs

Pricing works when it reflects how production actually operates: **throughput + risk + urgency**.

### Three common models
#### 1) Project pricing
Best for: defined scopes, single campaigns  
Risk: scope creep, rounds of amends

#### 2) Retainer (service bundle)
Best for: ongoing demand, predictable delivery  
Works when: you define deliverables and SLA clearly

#### 3) Capacity / pods
Best for: high volume, shifting priorities  
Works when: client trusts prioritisation and understands trade-offs

### The SLA table (minimum)
- Response time (brief → plan)
- First draft time
- Amendment rounds included
- Cut-off times for approvals
- What happens when the client is late

### The simplest rule
If the work involves **versioning at scale**, charge for:
- building the system (matrix, rules, templates),
- then a unit rate for variants,
- plus QA.

### Next step
