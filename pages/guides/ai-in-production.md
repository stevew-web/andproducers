## Where AI actually helps in creative production (and where it causes chaos)

AI is great at accelerating drafts. It’s dangerous when it invents facts, breaks brand rules, or bypasses approvals.

### Good use cases (low risk, high speed)
- First-pass copy variants (with strict guardrails)
- Alt text / accessibility drafts (human review)
- Rough storyboards and shot lists
- Summarising feedback into actions
- Naming suggestions and taxonomy cleanup

### Risk zones (govern harder)
- Claims (health, finance, performance promises)
- Brand voice for premium brands
- Anything that could be interpreted as legal advice
- Personal data handling (GDPR)

### Simple governance (so you can ship)
- Maintain a “do not say” list (claims, competitors, restricted terms)
- Require sources for factual statements
- Log prompts + outputs for regulated work
- Human sign-off remains mandatory
